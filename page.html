            All right.
            So let's jump in to day one of our Friday Challenge Day when we cover the brand.
            And what all chapter.Would we be covering?
            Chapter one would be about the branding chapter.To build a brand.People love.
        </p>
        <p>
            We go ahead and buy a domain name and posting Chapter five.
            We will be using WordPress as the WordPress at the Web site builder.
            So we will learn how to install WordPress and Chapter six.
            Sorry.
            We'll be setting up your email account.
            So chapter one, branding.
            So what exactly is a brand?
            I suppose you'd agree that a brand is more than just a, quote, local.
            When I was looking around for the perfect definition of a brand.
            I figured and realized that there are a number of vague and varied definitions of what exactly brands.
            For example, the American Marketing Association defines a brand as a name.
            Dumb design symbol or any other feature that identifies one sellers good or service as distinct from
            those of another fellow.Now, another example, another definition was a brand.
            It's a way a company, organization or individual is perceived by those who experience it.
        </p>
        <p>
            Great.
            So I suppose now we've got a decent and fair idea.
            What exactly A is.Next comes what is brand building.
            Quite simply put, brand building is creating awareness, of course.
            And you.
            How exactly do you go ahead and create awareness?Exactly.To marketing.
            There are various marketing strategies.
            And I guess you would agree the better your brand stands out in the crowd, the better the chances of your brand succeeding.
            Today, the promotion and marketing of your brand can be done to various digital marketing activities,
            such as to your website, to your social media, through email marketing, to BBC that basically paid advertising.

        <p>
            Build a Brand People Love:
            All right.Champion to build a brand.People love to let me start by asking your question.
            What, according to you, makes a brand successful?
            Is it the marketing?It's the visibility. Is it the logo?
            The brand name? All the bells and whistles around it?
            No.
            A brand become successful.
            If it solves a problem for the end user, you may have a great product, great packaging.
            You may have the budgets for the advertising.
            But honestly, if it really doesn't solve the problem your target audience is facing.
            You will not be successful and you will not make money.  Period.
            The famous entrepreneur, Sir Richard Branson, puts it across very bad.
            If your business genuinely improve people's lives, success will follow.
            Now, without digging too deep into each of these, I feel like to develop on a few points that you
            must consider while building your brand.
        </p>
        <p>
            Just for a small example, I would like to show you my own Web site, Brolga.
            Now upfront, right in front.
            I've actually mentioned I'm helping entrepreneurs build a successful online business.
            Now, I could have this and helping you build a successful online business.
            But I'm Grano knees down and generationally filter my exact flame till I'd like to target only entrepreneurs,
            someone who would like trying to set out into an online business.
            And I want to cater to them and help them succeed in terms of building their online presence.
            I very clearly guard my target audience mentioned upfront.
            I have a mission statement put out and be very clear as to who you're targeting and what exactly are
            you trying to achieve out of it.
            The third is basically research.
            Now you have to research your competitors.
            I mean, their brand.
            And what else is there in your industry on the same length, on your same platform.
        </p>
        <p>
            I like to had them build a successful online business.
            So I'd be very clear of who your target audience, because once you're clear about your target audience,
            all your marketing activities will revolve around them.
            Because let's say, for example, even if you're doing your online advertising, you would select.
            You don't want your message to be sending us to everyone.
            I mean, it's great to have a big reach, but at the end of the day, you need conversions and you get
            the missions on the field east of a target audience.
            So that happened on leave.
            And you are cleared of all your target audiences.
            Be very clear of a target audience.
            End of the day, there's no point selling ice to an Eskimo.
            All right.
            So let's get into chapatti, selecting a brand name.
        </p>
        <p>
            SELECTING A BRAND NAME:
            All right.
            Chapter three.
            Selecting a brand name.
            I hope the first two chapters give you a sort of a clear indication or even a roadmap of what exactly
            your brand must convey.
            And most importantly, I hope it has got your creative juices flowing because in this chapter, we will
            go ahead and select a brand new book.
            I'm not going to paint a rosy picture here by kids.
        </p>
        <p>
            Deciding on a brand name can take time after all.
            Once you do decide on a brand name, you would make a lot of decisions based on it.
            For example, your domain name, your logo, your email I.D., your business cards, your registrations,etc..
            So should you go in for a post to Limor?
            Should you go in for Nonperson one?
            Remember, your name is an extension of your brand.
            So when you're selecting a name for a business or a product or service, you have a number of options.
            One is you could use it personally.
            Now, in this digital space, I mean, I guess you all would probably north Neil Patel.
            Now, that's a brand by itself.No.
            You know, indeed, the online self-help and the the authors, you know, of Tony Robbins.
            So, you know, if Robin Sharma, these are brand name to image, the media really huge with their brand
            name, you could choose to go ahead with your own name or if you want to actually create a name and
            still be the face of actually doing not an assembly line test they need.
            But these are the Tony Robbins.
